## Five Phases of Conflict

Conflict - The interaction of **interdependent** people who **perceive**
incompaitibility

- Latent Phases
    * Potential for conflict exists
        * Pre-awareness
- Perceived Phases
    * Belief by one individual or more people that conditions for
    conflict exist
        * Awareness
- Felt Phase
    * Thinking what conflict means personally and planning what to do
    about it
        * Personalizing
- Manifest Phase
    * Individuals express the conflict verbally or nonverbally
    and how to deal with it
        * Interaction (escalation, rigidict)
    * Active phase, when communication takes place
- Aftermath phase
    * Short-term and long-term consequences of conflict
    * Integration

## Negotiating Styles

- Competition
- Compromise
- Collaboration
- Avoidance
- Accomodation

Collaboration always "best" style for negotiation. Takes too much time for every
circumstance. Not realistic.

- Win-Lose (competition)
- Compromise (Lose/Lose?)
- Win-Win Orientation (collaboration)
    * Ideal, but not practical
- Avoidance/Accommodation
    * Some say conflict should not be avoided
    * Avoiding not always bad though
    * Accomodation: One gains, other gives up, for possible future gain

Test questions come from these
